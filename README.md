# Book Search Project 📚🚀

Welcome to the **Book Search Project**! This is my fun little playground where I'm building a full-stack application to explore, search, and have fun with book data. The backend uses the **Google Books API** to fetch data, and the frontend will make it shine with a sleek interface. 

The main goal? Use as much **AWS** as possible while leveling up my skills! 💪✨

## 🌟 What’s the Plan?
- Fetch data from **Google Books API** 📖
- Build a powerful backend to process and serve the data ⚙️
- Create a beautiful frontend to search and browse books 🎨
- Deploy everything with **AWS** and automate it with **staging** and **production** environments 🌩️

- **GraphQL**: For efficient querying and API design 🚀
- **ElasticSearch**: For powerful search and autosuggestions 🔍✨
- **MongoDB**: Storing books with **AWS DocumentDB** 📂
- **AWS Services**: Let’s see how much of AWS I can squeeze in here 🌍

### Deployment
- **Staging and Production Environments**: Separate environments for safe feature testing and reliable deployments 🎯
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating the CI/CD pipelines for both environments 🚀

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: The frontend powerhouse ⚡
- **TypeScript** & **JavaScript**: Keeping it robust and clean 🧼
- **React Query**: Simplifying state management and data fetching 🔄
- **graphql-request**: Lightweight GraphQL client for clean and simple requests 🕸️
